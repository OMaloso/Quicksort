# Quicksort

A program that inputs numbers and then sorts them in order using Quicksort.

This program was created in my first year of university for a paper on algorithms and data structures.


### Instructions

Begin by entering either 0 or 1 to define if you want to sort your list of numbers by ascending or descending order.
Follow this by entering how many data elements you wish to sort.
Lastly, enter all data elements seperated by spaces, followed by enter.

The program will now display the above enetered data elements in either ascending or descending order as specified.
